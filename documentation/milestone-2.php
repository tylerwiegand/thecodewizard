		<h1>Wizard Mile(sword-in-the)stone Two</h1>
		<img src="../img/wizard2.jpg" alt="Merlin!!!" class="wizard" />
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			This page is to paint a metaphorical picture of what a super
			awesome wizarding themed "codefolio" (oo thats mine) should look
			and/or feel like. The big idea here is that there are plenty of
			obvious references to wizards and code. The intended audience is awesome
			people, employers, clients, students, wizards. The main goal of people
			that COME here should be to give me fat stacks of cash, wizard gold,
			or a letter to Hogwarts. The secondary goal is for people to widen
			their eyes in awizardment as they start to doubt their mortality for
			incredible sights their eyes have begun to comprehend.
		</p>
		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p>
			Name: Ivanna Castalot
		</p>
		<p>
			Age: 27
		</p>
		<p>
			Profession: Founder of Wizarding Weekly, Ivanna is a busy witch
			with a lot of time on her hands. Ivanna needs to convert her
			weekly publication into a wizard-friendly interwebs place. She also
			needs to make sure the proper charms are placed on the interweb place
			so that muggles cannot access the site. But who should she floo powder?
		</p>
		<p>
			Technology: Wand. No, but really, she has a custom built PC made by
			Arthur Weasley. And a wand.
		</p>
		<p>
			Attitudes and Behaviors: Ivanna spends all her time online now. She doesn't
			have a life. Her Gringott's vault overfloweth, and the only thing that drives
			her decision making process is, "How can I make the world a better place?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Frustrations and Needs: Ivanna wants to throw as much gold as she can
			at a moderately experienced young interwebs page developer. Ivanna secretly
			loves muggles, and will need to keep this project a secret from her investors.
			She hates poorly designed interweb pages, especially ones with no references
			to wizarding in general.
		</p>
		<p>
			Goals: Ivanna desperately needs to hire someone on, but secrecy is key. This muggle
			should have some sort of clearance to work on delicate projects. Ivanna spends
			hours researching people on monster.com. It's exhausting. But it's worth it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Use Case
			Ivanna Castalot has recently attended a soiree for networking and professional
			development. When she woke up the next morning, she found a business card slid
			deftly beneath her clothes. Impressed by this ambitious individual, Ivanna carefully
			reads the contact info and immediately, with haste and anticipation, navigates
			to the interweb page.
		</p>
		<p>
			After many hours of researching the proprietor of "thecodewizard.net" on her 27" screen,
			beastly PC Gaming Rig (courtesy Mr. Weasley) and (sadly) coming to the realization that
			the owner was NOT a wizard in fact, but in enthusiasm, Ivanna comes to the conclusion
			that this is the only muggle for her. Professionally.
		</p>
		<p>
			Minute One: Ivanna is blown away by the animated wizard appearance similar to
			Mickey Mouse from the Mickey Mouse Club. Amazeballs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Minute Two: Ivanna scrolls up and down and clicks on Ellas super dope bejewelled game.
		</p>
		<p>
			Minute Three Hundred: Ivanna reads a few articles that fade into contrast letter by letter as you
			mouse over the box containing them. She mouses over the pictures that seem to move, similar
			pictures in her world. Breathtaking. Ivanna sees the email at the bottom (same as the business
			card), and clicks it to open a form to email our Code Wizard.

		<h2>Proposed Site Map</h2>
		<p>
			One Page, many things on page, such as:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>THECODEWIZARD.NET title page</li>
			<li>Articles of success stories</li>
			<li>Pictures of people working, playing, and casting</li>
			<li>Contact Info</li>
			<li>Mom</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<strong>Title Page</strong> will consist of the mickey mouse wizard popping out of a circle. His eyes
			will shift around all shifty.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Quotes</strong> of success story articles (clicking the article excerpts will fill in the blank
			spaces on the front and back as a popup that seamlessly blends in with the original text).
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Pictures</strong> of people working playing and casting, which is the site's motto. Casting is
			intended to be euphemistic for coding. That will be understood from the picture of the
			dude coding with a gigantic caption of CAST.
		</p>
		<p>
			My <strong>contact info</strong> will appear upon clicking "About Me." THEIR contact info will pop up
			upon clickage of "About You," and will freak them out. That's right, freak them out.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Awesome Stuff</strong> will pop up a simple tile view of other pages I have created (capstone?).
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Mom</strong> will pop up a rounded-off-edges white bubble talk-box lookin thing with a pic
			of my mom. How sweet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Obligatory google adsense implemented as tastelessly as possible. Willing to negotiate
			this implementation.
		</p>
		<h2>Proposed Features and Functionality</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Clicking links will either pop up a bubbley white dialogue lookin thingy OR scroll up or down to content.</li>
			<li>Mousing over text will create a sheen effect to highlight the excerpt.</li>
			<li>Mousing over images will slowly begin their subtle animation.</li>
			<li>Clicking on the wizard will open a little talk bubble next to his head with a form to email me.</li>
			<li>Wizards on broomsticks will fly by in a cartoonish fashion in the background.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Stretchy Goals</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Background will change with time of day.</li>
			<li>Theme will shift in reaction to time of day to be readable.</li>
			<li>Any animation is considered a stretch goal.</li>
		</ul>
