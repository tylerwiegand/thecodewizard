		<h1>Mile at Rock 3</h1>
		<h2>Mobile Layout</h2>
			<img src="../img/codewizardmobile.jpg" alt="CodeWizard Mobile Wireframe" />
			<p>
				So the general idea here is that the user will scroll down or click on the CTA
				to select the desired section (which are few at this point, but can expand). Every
				option won't be layed out on the initial visible space, but the two most important
				ones will. As the user scrolls down, sections will expand. The code sample
				will have the code on one side that fades out as it gets closer to the bottom
				of the page, and the result of the code will be formatted similiarly on the right side
				of the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the bottom, contact me and mom will pop up into the shown windows and will not have separate
				pages dedicated to them. The about me is its own section, and just moves you upward to the
				<code>#spot.</code>
			</p>
		<h2>Desktop Layout</h2>
		<img src="../img/codewizarddesktop.jpg" alt="CodeWizard Desktop Wireframe" />
			<p>
				Desktop version will be another affair entirely -- the screen will scroll to the right instead of down
				with a playable character on the screen for the user to playfully navigate through the site. The playable
				wizard will go up a ladder, fall into a lake, crawl out and end up at Mom toward the end.
			</p>
			<p>
				Along his journey, the wizards presence will expand the sections available. However, if the user
				indicates they do NOT want to be taken on a magical journey, the wizard sits down disheartened and
				just looks annoyed while scrolling down goes right and the page reacts to movements of the user instead.
				OF COURSE IT'S A STRETCH GOAL!
